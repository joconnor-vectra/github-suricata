Description: Next Generation Intrusion Detection and Prevention Tool - debug symbols
 Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System (IDS). It is based on
 rules (and is fully compatible with snort rules) to detect a variety of
 attacks / probes by searching packet content.
 .
 This package contains the debug symbols for Suricata.
